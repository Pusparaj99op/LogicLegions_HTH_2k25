# Arduino Projects

This folder contains Arduino sketches and projects for various Arduino boards including:
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Nano
- Arduino Mega
- Other Arduino-compatible boards

## Structure
Each project should be in its own folder with the main `.ino` file having the same name as the folder.

Example:
```
arduino_projects/
├── blink_led/
│   └── blink_led.ino
├── servo_control/
│   └── servo_control.ino
└── sensor_readings/
    └── sensor_readings.ino
```

## Getting Started
1. Create a new folder for your project
2. Add your `.ino` file with the same name as the folder
3. Include any additional files (headers, libraries) as needed
4. Use VSCode's Arduino extension to compile and upload
